# Dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles and scripts.

The files in the `home` directory are [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)able
packages. Check out that directory's README for more info.

This repo is definitely under construction. I have many miscellaneous scripts I
want to add here that I haven't had the chance to quite yet.
